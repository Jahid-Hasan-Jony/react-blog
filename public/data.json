    "content": "React Hooks revolutionized functional components by providing features like state management and side effects handling. Introduced in React 16.8, hooks such as `useState` and `useEffect` eliminate the need for class components, simplifying the codebase. Hooks allow developers to write reusable logic, making components more readable and maintainable. Advanced hooks like `useReducer`, `useContext`, and custom hooks provide additional flexibility. By adopting hooks, developers can create more predictable and testable applications. In this blog, we provide practical examples and best practices to help you harness the full potential of React Hooks in your projects.",
